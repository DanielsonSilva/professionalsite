# Danielson Silva Professional Site

This is the code that I use to create my own professional website to show
my skills in PHP programming and others programming languages needed to create
a complete website with several projects.

This will be incremental, i.e., new projects will appear on the professional
websites concerning gaming, RPG, applications to everyday use, data organization,
BI dashboards and other areas.
